            <h2>San Antonio, FL</h2>
                <p>My grandparents raised me in this small town. This is also where my mother and her two sisters were raised. Pictured below is St.Anthony's catholic school at the heart of the town. My mother, her two sisters, my older brother and I all attended this school.Always looked haunted to me. </p>

            <h2>Gerhardsbrunn, DE</h2>
                <p>Gerhardsbrunn Germany is by far the most beautiful place I have lived. The landscape, architecture, and lifestyle is something I had not and have not since incountered. It is such a small village that I had trouble finding images. Every few days I would walk to the dairy, throw my three &euro; coins in a cup, and fill our jugs with fresh milk from a spicket. The town was always calm. When I walked the streets I would see cows, horses, goats, and the residents tending there beautiful gardens. During the fall the fields would be overflowing with pumpkins. When it snowed it was always the perfect amount, I could build a respectable snowman while not worrying about shoveling the drive. The summers were seldom hot, but when it was it was a dry heat that was hard to bare because there was no A/C, but it was worth it.</p>

            <h2>Macungie, PA</h2>
                <p>I moved to Macungie Pensylvania on a whim. After eves dropping on a conversation about a nanny job and decided to jump at the oprotunity. Two days later I was on the road to PA with a nice older man I had just met, probably not the best decision I've made now that I think about it.Macungie was suburbia, filled with potholes and soccer moms. I took care of three children aged 5, 7, and 9. We lived on a culdesac and the weather was pretty nice until winter. Shoveling snow is not fun. Other than that the best thing about living here was being so close to New York City.</p>

           <h2>Boca Raton, FL</h2>
           
           <p>After my stint as a live in nanny I made the move to South Florida and landed in Boca Raton. Boca Raton Florida is beautiful and bugiee. The beaches are gorgous, the city is clean, and the people have their dogs in carriges and kids on leashes. I never planned on staying long, but ended up getting a seasonal part time job-turned 5 year career. Oops.   </p>
